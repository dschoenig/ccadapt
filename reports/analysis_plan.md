# Analysis plan

## Data preparation

**Goal**

Prepare data for regression analysis.

**Steps**

- Code all categorical variables as factors, taking into account all possible categories (including those that do not appear in any of the answers)
- Consistent coding of `NA`s
- Transform all categorical variables into sets of binary (dummy) variables
	- Keep a list to define which binary variables are part of which categorical variable
- Define groups of variables:
	- Response variables
	- Explanatory variables:
		- Binary variables
		- Continuous variables
	- Demographic and auxiliary covariates (gender, age, occupation, etc.)
	- Other variables not taken into account for statistical analysis (comments, etc.)

**Result**

Analysis-ready data containing ID, response variables, explanatory variables, and covariates.

## Data exploration

### Correlation

**Goal**

Arrive at a first understanding of relationships between variables, and potential clusters of interrelated variables.

**Steps**

- Pairwise correlation coefficients (Spearman's œÅ) between:
- response variables and other variables
- Among all explanatory variables and covariates

**Results**

- Heat map for each response variable
- Heat map for explanatory variables and covariates
- List of most influential variables (when considered in isolation) 

### Variable selection

**Goal**

Define a subset of explanatory variables to be considered for further statistical analysis, based on the strength of their relationship with the response variables.

**Steps**

- For each response variable, set up a Bayesian multinomial model with all explanatory variables (covariates are excluded).
- Define a horseshoe prior over the explanatory variables (using a proportion of ??)
- For all binary variables with non-zero effect: Identify corresponding categorical variable

**Result**

List of explanatory variables to be taken into account for further statistical analysis.
