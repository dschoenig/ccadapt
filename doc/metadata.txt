# Variables

## Variable description

File: `var/variables.csv`

`id`
:   Integer identifier of the variable (corresponds to the column number   in the limesurvey output).

code
:   Unique alphanumeric code for each variable.

name
:   Full name of the variable (as provided in limesurvey output).

main
:   Name of the main question (substring of `name`).

sub
:   Name of the subquestion (substring of `name`). Empty if there are no subquestions.

type
:   Type of the variable. Either `categorical`, `continuous`, or `qualitative`.

cat.scale
:   If the `type` is `categorical`, `cat.scale` indicates the scale of possible answers (i.e. the levels) that correspond to the variable. More information on the scales is provided in the file `cat.levels.csv`.

cat.ref
:   If the `type` is `categorical`, `cat.ref` indicates the reference level of the variable. If, a priori, there was no natural choice for the reference level (as in the case of gender), it was chosen based on response frequency.

cat.ord
:   If the `type` is `categorical`, `cat.ord` indicates (`TRUE` or `FALSE`) whether the categories of the variable are ordered.

cont.mean
:   If the `type` is `continuous`, `cont.mean` indicates the mean of the responses over the sample.

cont.sd
:   If the `type` is `continuous`, `cont.sd` indicates the standard deviation of the responses over the sample.

category.*
:   Indicates whether the variable belongs, respectively, to the group of variables related to *personal stakes*, *threat appraisal*, *coping appraisal*, *control*, or *adaptation*. The groups *personal stakes*, *threat appraisal*, and *coping appraisal* are not mutually exclusive (one variable can belong to several groups). However, if a variable belongs to either either the group `control` or `adaptation`, it cannot be part of another group. The `control` variables correspond to demographic control variables, and the `adaptation` variables correspond to adaptive behaviours. 

question.main
:   String of the main question, as formulated in the English language survey.

question.sub
:   String of the subquestion, as formulated in the English language survey.


## Levels for categorical variables

File: `var/cat.levels.csv`

cat.scale
:   Identifies the scale (lower-case letter).

level.id
:   Identifies the position of the level within the corresponding scale (integer).

level
:   String of the level, as formulated in the English language survey.
	

# Results

## Variable selection and importance

File: `willingness/varsel/var.sel.csv`

resp
:   Identity of the binary version of the adaptation variable (used as a response variable), corresponding to the codes in the variable table. `Count` represents the sum of all ten binary adaption variables.

size 
:   Ranking of the explanatory variable given in `expl`. This ranking also corresponds of the number of variables present in the model (i.e. model size). For example, a size of `5` means that the variable given in `expl` is the fifth-most important variable, and it starts to be part of the model once the model contains 5 variables in total (and it will also be contained in all models of a larger size). A `size` of `Inf` correspnds to the full model (i.e. the model that contains all possible variables).

size.sel
:   Size of the model chosen according to a decision rule. As a decision rule, we chose: the selected model is the most parsimonious model whole performance is closer to the best model than to the null model. As performance measure, we use the difference in ELPD to the best model. And the best model can either be the full model or one of the submodels with a reduced number of predictors. A performance threshold is established halfway between the null model and the best model. The selected model is then the "smallest" model that clears this performance thresholdby at least on standard error.

count.sel
:   How often was the variable given in `expl` selected across all adaptation variables?

expl
:   Identity of the explanatory variable, corresponding to the codes in `var/variables.csv`.

category
:   Group that the explanatory variable belongs to (either `personal_stakes`, `threat_appraisal`, `coping_appraisal`, `control`). If an explanatory variable belongs to several groups, it will appear several times for the same adaptations variable.

diff
:   Performance difference of the submodel against the best model.

diff.lq
:   Lower uncertainty bound of the performance difference, corresponding to an uncertainty interval that is 2 standard errors wide.

diff.uq
:   Upper uncertainty bound of the performance difference, corresponding to an uncertainty interval that is 2 standard errors wide.


## IRT: Marginal effects

File: `willingness/irt/predictions.csv`

This table accompanies the plots of the marginal effect estimates in `plots/irt/response.pdf` and `plots/irt/link.pdf`.

var.code
:   Identity of the explanatory variable for which the marginal effect is calculated. Corresponds to the codes in `var/variables.csv`.

adapt.code
:   Identity of the adaptation variable for which the marginal effect is calculated. Corresponds to the codes in `var/variables.csv`.

var.level
:   Level (or value) of the explanatory variable for which the marginal effect is calculated.

prob.median, prob.q5, prob.q25, prob.q75, prob.q95
:    Predicted response (i.e. probability of the willingness to adapt) for the adaptation variable if the explanatory variable is set to `var.level`. Provided are the median, as well as the 5th, 25th, 75th, and 95th percentiles. The 50% equal-tailed Bayesian credible interval is situated between the 25th and 75th percentiles. The 90% interval is situated between the 5th and 95th percentiles. These values are presented graphically in `plots/irt/prob.pdf`.

n
:   For *categorical* predictors: Number of responses for the given level of the explanatory variable. For *continuoues* predictors: Number of responses closest to the given value of the explanatory variable.


## IRT: Comparisons

File: `willingness/irt/comparisons.csv`

This table accompanies the plots of the comparison matrices in `plots/irt/response.pdf` and `plots/irt/link.pdf`.

var.code
:   Identity of the explanatory variable for which marginal effects are compared. Corresponds to the codes in `var/variables.csv`.

adapt.code
:   Identity of the adaptation variable for which the marginal effects are compared. Corresponds to the codes in `var/variables.csv`.

var.level1
:   [Categorical predictors only] The first of two levels of the explanatory variable that are compared against each other.

var.level2
:   [Categorical predictors only] The second of two levels of the explanatory variable that are compared against each other.

var.level.cont
:   [Continuous predictors only] The value of the explanatory variable at which the slope was evaluated.

prob.slope.diff.median
:   [Continuous predictors only] Median slope (also called "effect"), that is the (instantaneous) change of willingness to adapt, calculated at `var.level.cont`. The slope is expressed in percentage points per variable unit.

prob.slope.diff.ci.u
:   [Continuous predictors only] Lower limit of the 90% credibility interval for the slope.

prob.slope.diff.ci.u
:   [Continuous predictors only] Lower limit of the 90% credibility interval for the slope.

prob.diff.median
:   [Categorical predictors only] Median difference in willingness to adapt, calculated between `var.level1` and `var.level1`. The difference is expressed in percentage points.

prob.diff.ci.u
:   [Categorical predictors only] Lower limit of the 90% credibility interval for the difference in willingness to adapt.

prob.diff.ci.u
:   [Categorical predictors only] Upper limit of the 90% credibility interval for the difference in willingness to adapt.

cert.diff.pos
:   For *categorical* predictors: Certainty that `var.level1` *increases* the willingness to adapt, compared to `var.level2`. For continuous predictors: Certainty that the slope is positive.

cert.diff.neg 
:   For *categorical* predictors: Certainty that `var.level1` *decreases* the willingness to adapt, compared to `var.level2`. For continuous predictors: Certainty that the slope is negative.
